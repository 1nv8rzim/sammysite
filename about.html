                            On November 26th, 1909 at the College of the City of New York, Sigma Alpha Mu was founded by eight sophomores. Eighty-two years later at RIT five men saw a need for something more than what the current fraternity system at RIT provided. On October 22nd of that year, the first meeting of the Octagon Club took place. People came and left the group daily,  it was a struggle to find members who were committed. With persistence and hard work, Special Interest Group status was granted under the Greek Council. With our presence on campus increasing, the Octagon Club started to look at national fraternities. Sigma Alpha Mu seemed like the perfect fit for the men of the Octagon Club and on November 2nd of 1996 Delta Omega chapter was chartered.

                        <p>
                            Today, Sigma Alpha Mu - Delta Omega chapter is dedicated to instilling strong fraternal values, offering social and service opportunities, encouraging academic excellence and teaching leadership skills. Known as “Sammy” on campus, this past year the Sammys raised over $3,000 at our week long philanthropy event, PoleSit, and debuted a brand new event - ActNow: a suicide awareness and prevention presentation. Our chapter harbors fine young men spanning eight different colleges, from all walks of life. We pride ourselves on making young men into the best possible people they can be. Proud To Be.
